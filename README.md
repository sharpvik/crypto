# Crypto 

Crypto is a simple encrypt - decrypt web application created to explore the processes and mechanisms used while transforming plaintext into the ciphertext. 

## How to install Crypto

Just for now, Crypto exists as a GitHub project so you can only download it on your local machine and open it locally. Double click on the `index.html` and you’re good to go!

However, I want to upload Crypto onto the HTTPS secure server. This will allow you to use additional function of sending your encrypted or decrypted message directly to someone’s email. To do this you have a paper-plane button but it won't work on a local machine.

## How to use Crypto

When you open the application - you’ll see a simple interface that looks like a translator. In the bottom of the screen you may notice two tabs named **ENCRYPT** and **DECRYPT**. At first, the **ENCRYPT** tab will be active.

### How to encrypt

It is very simple to encrypt the message using Crypto. 

* Input some text. 
* Click **ENCRYPT>** button. 

In the green box below you’ll see 10 digits written in the bold font and your encrypted text below this 10 digits code. 

> These numbers are, by the way, very important, it is the **decryption key**. These will be used to decrypt your message.  

### How to decrypt

* Switch to the **DECRYPT** tab. 
* Input a **decryption key** that was given to you. 
* Input a ciphertext. 
* Click the **DECRYPT>** button.

The plaintext will appear in the green box below.
